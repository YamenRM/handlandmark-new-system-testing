# Computer Vision Playground

Computer Vision Playground is an interactive computer vision application built with Streamlit, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI.  
The project demonstrates real-time face tracking, hand tracking, gesture control, and visual effects using a webcam.

## Features

### Face Landmark Detection
Detects and tracks facial landmarks in real time using your webcam.  
The application visualizes facial key points to demonstrate how computer vision models understand facial structure.

### Hand Landmark Detection
Tracks hand movements and identifies finger positions using MediaPipe's hand tracking model.

### AR Hand Effect
A transparent **Doctor Strange hand effect** is overlaid on the detected hand.  
The image follows the hand in real time, creating a simple augmented reality experience.

### Gesture-Based Mouse Control
Hand gestures are translated into mouse actions such as:
- Cursor movement
- Clicking
- Basic interaction without touching the mouse

### Virtual Drawing Mode 
- Turn your finger into a digital brush.
- Draw on the screen in real-time using hand gestures.
- Features include clear screen options and smooth tracking.

## Assets and Models

used models:

- `models/` → [handlandmarker model](https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/hand_landmarker/hand_landmarker/float16/latest/hand_landmarker.task) ,
  [facelandmarker model](https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/face_landmarker/face_landmarker/float16/latest/face_landmarker.task)
- `assets/` → [dr.strange hand img](https://pngtree.com/so/dr-strange)

## How It Works

1. The webcam captures video frames.
2. OpenCV processes the frames.
3. MediaPipe detects face and hand landmarks.
4. The program interprets gestures or positions.
5. Visual effects or mouse actions or drawing strokes are applied in real time.
